#Creating Module and Using Require in NodeJs#
1)We create a module by using the keyword module.export and then assign it with the property that we want to use in 
another file.
2)Then we use Require module so that we can fetch the module as and when required.

#Module Patterns#
1)we can use concept of prototype and dunder properties to make things going on 
for instance we can use module.export.<any name> = nameOfProperty
2)or else we can directly assign the value for the property using direct assignment method
